# Inverted Index

## General info

This system model builds an inverted index in a parallel environment. 
Inverted index is a data structure in which for each word of document 
collections in the corresponding list the positions of the words in the 
document are overframed and the path to the documents - in which it 
occurs. An inverted index is used to search for texts.

## Run in an IDEA

If you want to run the examples in an IDEA, you should be able to copy 
the entire contents of any one of the folder into a project in the IDE, 
and then run the programs. 
Note: Do not copy the folder itself; open the folder and copy the contents.

## Compile an run on the comand line

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have
downloaded the programm, you can easily compile and run programm. Just 
change into one of the chapter directories inside "sources" and use
the command 

                  javac ExampleClassName.java
                  
to compile programm from folder. You can then run individual programs 
using the java command. For example:

                  java ExampleClassName
